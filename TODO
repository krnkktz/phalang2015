write as many operators as possible in phalang, after having implemented infix,
non builtin operators

find a better solution than the (probably shitty) lib keyword

find a better solution for comments

keep writing the ulambda ; pimping the output (only display number for the
entire expression)

write tlambda

compile to something fun (bytecode? asm?)
